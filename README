Fast NMF solver: version 0
--------------------

Find non-negative factors W and H, of a non-negative matrix F so that || F - WH || (frobineus norm) is minimized. A new algorithm similar to the algorithm used in Nandan et al. 2014 (JMLR) is used. 

Instructions:

1. Run make to compile.
2. Call as $ ./AENMF <input file in LibSVM format with X> R <desired file for W> <desired file for H>
The last three parameters are optional. example (1) $ ./AENMF ../data/mnist 20 w.dat h.dat
										example (2) $ ./AENMF ../data/mnist

3. The output files are also in LibSVM/SVMlight format.
4. The Frobenius norm error of each iteration is displayed.
